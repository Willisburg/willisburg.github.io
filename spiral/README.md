# Spiral visualization

A project inspired by a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ) by 3Blue1Brown. Continued from my previous [project](https://github.com/Willisburg/willisburg.github.io/tree/main/gridspiral).

## Controls:
- scale slider increases/decreases both the scale and point count.
- if the "check primes" switch is turned off, mod slider changes the criteria. The value of a point must be divisible by the criteria.
- if the "check primes" switch is turned on, mod slider will do nothing. Only points with prime values show up.
- text size slider increases and decreases the size of text. (not very useful)
