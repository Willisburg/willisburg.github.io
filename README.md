## Willisburg's portfolio

A small website I designed to showcase my work.

As you may have noticed, right now it is a bit barren, a lot of projects i have are unorganized. For now I have cleaned up my most recent two projects for showcase.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Willisburg/willisburg.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
